## General Coding Standards

- **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Line Length:** Limit lines to 80 characters where possible.
- **Brace Style:** K&R style for braces.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions.
  - `PascalCase` for React components and classes.
  - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- **Commenting:** Use comments to explain complex logic. Use JSDoc for functions.

## React and Component Guidelines

- **Component Structure:**
  - Prefer functional components and hooks.
  - Keep components small and focused.
- **Props and State:**
  - Validate props with prop-types.
  - Keep state minimal and derived.
- **File and Folder Structure:**
  - Organize by feature/domain.
  - Use `index.js` for exports.

## Styling and CSS Practices

- **Styling Approaches:** CSS-in-JS (styled-components, emotion).
- **CSS Conventions:** BEM methodology for class naming.

## Testing Guidelines

- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- **Testing Tools:** Jest and Testing Library.
- **Best Practices:** Deterministic tests; mock external dependencies.

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Handling:** Use try-catch and display user-friendly messages.
- **Logging:** Consistent format; avoid sensitive information.

## Code Review Process

- **Code Reviews:** Mandatory for all changes. Focus on quality, best practices, and bugs.
- **Pull Requests:** Clear descriptions and reference relevant issues.
